  summary = {[LGM*17] has developed a visual analytics tool called EVA, which integrates visual analytics into the fraud detection process with the goal of reducing false positives and improving the accuracy of identifying fraudulent transactions. This system is specifically designed to detect unauthorized transactions by comparing ongoing transactions to predefined customer profiles and scoring transactions based on their deviation from typical behavioral patterns. EVA displays transaction data using a time view, a score construction view, and a scatterplot. EVA has been verified to improve the accuracy and efficiency of fraud detection.}

  summary = {[GLY*22] developed a visual analysis system called RankFIRST that focuses on factor investment analysis by ranking stock time series. The study is based on a comprehensive data evaluation of the Chinese stock market over the past 30 years, which involves data such as daily opening and closing prices, trading volume, etc. The RankFIRST system integrates a complete factor investing process, including the selection of factors, the ranking of stocks, the construction of portfolios, and the subsequent backtesting of investment performance. The system uses a hierarchical ramp chart design to display the time series ranking of factors and introduces a novel fireworks chart to show stock time series. The effectiveness of the system is validated through case studies and controlled user studies.}

  summary = {[HL22] explored how to effectively use stacked graphs to visualize multidimensional financial time series data. Their research focuses on optimizing the stacking order by minimizing the cumulative variance rule and optimizing the label positions and text colors by using the width-first principle and the color-complementary principle to vividly reveal the characteristics of stock exchange capital flows among different industries. Through quantitative analysis and user questionnaires, this paper not only improves the aesthetics and readability of the visualization, but also has more advantages over traditional methods in reducing visual perturbations and enhancing data readability.}

The transaction history view presents transaction data through a timeline, while the transaction topology view utilizes a self-organizing mapping (SOM) algorithm to present the topology of the data through matrices and force-directed projections. The research team collaborated with fraud experts to develop this user-centered tool and validated its effectiveness through a user study. }
